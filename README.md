# WD-SMCS
This repository contains codes for numerical experiments in parameter estimation from aggregate observations, which is the source code of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14950.

The Social force model example is implemented with C++. The folder "sim_code_room" contains codes for producing the observation data and the folder "smcs_code_room" contains codes for implementing the WD-SMCS method.

The Intelligent driver model example is implemented with Python in the "traffic_flow" folder. One can generate the observation data with 'gen_data.py' and implement the WD-SMCS method with 'smcs.py'.

Observation data is provided in the folder "observation".
